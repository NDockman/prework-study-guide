# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- The motivation for the creation of this webpage is to enable me to study for bootcamp.
- I built this webpage so that I can be prepared for bootcamp by the time it starts.
- This webpage organizes notes from topics I learned during the prework. Now all of my notes are in one place.
- While creating this webpage I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and how they work together to make a webpage.
